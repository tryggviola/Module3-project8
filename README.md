# Module3 / Project 8 / UI Redesign

## Project Brief 

Recreate a website with these in mind: 

* Let the UI design "breathe"
* Create calmness and order with alignment
* Use of contrast in design elements and color
* The 60-30-10 rule in use of color palettes
* Use of scale in design elements and visual hierarchy
* Recognition of emotional cognition in the use of typography

## The Goal
Be Able to elevate a design through these fundamental UI design practices

## Intro 
My favorite pizza place and neighbours is Pizza King in Skipholti, their pizza is awesome but their website not so much. I wanted to create a page that I though represented them with a little insperation from King of Hip hop, Notorious B.I.G.

## The Process 
I wanted a really simple cartoony style so I chose a simple font and really simple color pallet inspired by the Italian flag. I started by drawing the logo and all the pictures in <strong>ProCreate</strong> on my iPad and after I finished that I put everything together in <strong>Figma</strong>.

## The Journey 
This was an awesome project, I really liked the freedom to do what I wanted to do and I had a lot of fun creating this silly website. I loved to get a chance to draw something even though it is quite simple. I really like the final product and I hope you do as well. 

## Features and functions 
The site is really basic but there are some hover effects and a custom navigation tab. Every picture on it is drawn by me and I spent most of the time doing that. 

## Conclusin 
Creating something from scratch and having the freedom to some original drawings and design was great. I really like the final product and I think it is silly but interesting and I hope you do too.
